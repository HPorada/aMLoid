## Analysis of cross-interactions of amyloid signaling sequences using machine learning techniques

### Introduction
The repository contains the code and datasets used in the mater's thesis project, "Analysis of cross-interactions of amyloid signaling sequences using machine learning techniques". The project focused on implementation and analysis of chosen machine learning solutions, considering their usage for the analysis of interacting amyloid sequences.

### Datasets
Datasets used in the project were obtained from publications:
1. Motif HRAM - Daskalov A, Dyrka W, Saupe S, ,,Theme and variations: evolutionary diversification of the HET-s functional amyloid motif'', Sci Rep 5, 2015, doi: 10.1038/srep12494
2. Motif BASS - Dyrka W, Coustou V, Daskalov A, Lends A, Bardin T, et al, ,,Identification of NLR-associated Amyloid Signaling Motifs in Bacterial Genomes'', Journal of Molecular Biology, 2020, doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2020.10.004.
